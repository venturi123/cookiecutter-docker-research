# cookiecutter-docker-research

👋 Welcome to the QuickStart Deep Learning project! This repository is your one-stop-shop, equipped with a Docker setup that lets you kick off a PyTorch with CUDA deep learning project in under ten minutes. Let's dive in!

## Features

- **Rapid Setup**: ⏰ Go from zero to hero in under ten minutes with comfortable out-of-the-box configurations!
- **PyTorch Integration with CUDA Support**: 🚀 Harness the power of PyTorch and CUDA for cutting-edge deep learning applications, maximizing your GPU's potential based on the [PyTorch NGC Container](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/pytorch).
- **Non-root user start-up:** 🪪 Avoid permission issues when accessing files generated by the Docker container on the host.
- **Efficient Compression**: 🥪 Achieve fast and high compression ratios with [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/).
- **Easy Packaging and Reproduction**: 📦 Simplify packaging and ensure easy reproducibility of your environment and projects.
- **Optimized for Remote Development UX**: 🛠 Tailored to enhance your development experience in Visual Studio Code with the [Remote development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) and [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extensions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Currently supported Linux releases (using staled Linux is not a wise choice)
- [NVIDIA GPU Drivers](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/tesla/tesla-installation-notes/index.html) (not necessary to install the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit)
- [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Quick Start 🌪️

How can you build a clear project with just 5 commands in 10 minutes? Just watch!

```shell
# Download and initialize the cookiecutter template in interactive mode
cookiecutter gh:venturi123/cookiecutter-docker-research

# Change the working directory to the project folder
cd {path/to/your/project}

# Build the Nvidia PyTorch Docker image
make init

# Start a Docker container instance
make create-container

# Attach to the container
# You can safely use this command every time you lose connection
make attach-container

# Test your image and container, also the NVIDIA/CUDA environment
make verify-cuda

# Finished!
echo "Everything is done! Enjoy it!"
```

> Something went wrong? Want to remove everything? No problem!

```shell
# Remove all images and containers
make clean-docker

# Or just remove the container
make clean-container-force

# Attention: You should be very careful using the following command.
# Not only will the Docker image/container be removed, but the project folder will also be purged.
# Remove everything as if nothing happened
make destroying
```

> Finished the whole project and want to archive it? Don't trust network storage? Want to keep everything local? Just one command!

> [!CAUTION]
> Please do not overly rely on this feature. The author disclaims any warranty for your data security. Data backups should follow the [3-2-1 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup#:~:text=The%203%2D2%2D1%20rule,this%20can%20include%20cloud%20storage).

```shell
# The entire workdir and Docker environment will be packaged within one single file
make archive
```

The container will first be archived as `{project_name}-image-{date}.tar` and placed in the `{project}` directory. Then, the `{project_name}.tar.zst` and `{project_name}.tar.zst.sha256` files will be generated in the same directory as the project directory.

> Want to relive your experience from many years ago but can't remember what you did on that unremarkable afternoon? 

```shell
# Verify the integrity of the archive file, ensuring that it has not been altered or corrupted via SHA256
sha256sum -c {project_name}.tar.zst.sha256

# Rebuild everything
make reproduce
```

Follow the tips on the screen to enter the container:

```shell
Enter the container using the command:
docker exec -it {project_name}-container-20240520195529 /bin/bash
```

Just run the script in the folder. It's that simple!
